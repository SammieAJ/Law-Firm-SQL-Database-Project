# Law-Firm-SQL-Database-Project
This project simulates the operations of a law firm using a relational database.   It demonstrates SQL skills such as creating tables, filtering data, joining tables, updating records, deleting records, and using aggregate functions.  

The project was designed to practice SQL concepts such as:
.Database creation
.Table relationships (Primary & Foreign Keys)
.SELECT statements
.JOIN operations
.UPDATE and DELETE queries
.Filtering with WHERE clauses


The database is powered by three main CSV files (imported into SQL Server / SSMS):
.Clients Table – stores client details
.Lawyers Table – stores lawyer details
.Cases Table – links clients and lawyers with information about ongoing/closed cases
